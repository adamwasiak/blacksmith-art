## Milestone Project 1
### Purpose

The target audience for this website are users interested in blacksmith related art and who may be looking to engage with the artist for commercial purposes.

##Website design 
The website consists of 3 pages, homepage, my work (gallery) and contact form page. Each of the pages contains links to the remaining 2 pages of the website, through the navigation links placed in the top right corner of the screen.
**Concept**- the key concept was to create a simple, eye pleasing website, with a well-balanced contrasts and color.
**Colors** and background- the colors are primarily grey and light grey in terms of fonts and background.
Typography – I have selected font “Dancing Script” with sans-serif as a fall-back font for logo and welcome message on the website. The specific font of “Dancing Script” was sourced from Google Fonts library.
