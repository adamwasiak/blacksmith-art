## Milestone Project 1
### Purpose 
The website was created for the purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications). The website was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML and CSS Modules in the course.
The target audience for this website are users interested in blacksmith related art and who may be looking to engage with the artist for commercial purposes. 
The key purpose of the website is to showcase some of the work completed by the artist and provide basis for promotion of work in the web and opportunities to engage with potential clients.

## Website design 
The website consists of 3 pages, homepage, my work (gallery) and contact form page. Each of the pages contains links to the remaining 2 pages of the website, through the navigation links placed in the top right corner of the screen.
-**Concept**- the key concept was to create a simple, eye pleasing website, with a well-balanced contrasts and color.
-**Colors** and background- the colors are primarily grey and light grey in terms of fonts and background.
Typography – I have selected font “Dancing Script” with sans-serif as a fall-back font for logo and welcome message on the website. The specific font of “Dancing Script” was sourced from Google Fonts library.

## Features 
### Home Page
The navigation bar consists of a logo “Blacksmith Art by Jan Wasiak” and Home, My Work and Contact me link to respective pages. The logo itself functions as a home button and bring the users back to the home page.


**Main Section**
The main section contains a welcome message styled with the “Dancing Script” font. The purpose of the message is to welcome user on the website and through the font provide sense of artistic nature of the content.
Subsequent sections, within the main section of the homepage, contain brief information on the artist, his workshop and his vision for his work.

**Footer**
The footer features simple icons linking users to real and active Instagram and Etsy accounts. Facebook icon takes users to Facebook’s landing page. Each icon will open respective external website in new window in line with industry standards.

### My Work 
This page of the website features set of images reflecting artist’s work. The idea of this section of the website was to keep it simple as a gallery with a set of aligned images.

### Contact me
This section of the website allows users to engage with the artist directly through a contact form. The contact form allows for a message to be included, apart from the core details of the user such as Name, Surname and Email address. All of the sections of the contact form are validated for contacted, including the email address section, which is validated for format of the information and to ensure that an actual email is being submitted. The contact me page styles the background with thyme related image.
